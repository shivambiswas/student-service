Project Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was part of a product called V-Optimer as a junior QA, was doing manual as well as api testing for billing module
where i had to do UI testing for verious UI elements like graphs,tables, paginations etc.
and tested various APIs that are used in the billing module, like customer call record history,its duration and date and time.

The product was all about giving a transparent views of useage/utilizations of calls, data, messages to the customers
in a better graphical representaion.

Tools:  JIRA, Confluence, Sharepoint, postman(For API Testing), RDM
Technologies used: Web services(ie REST) SOAP you didn't used
JIRA:- Defect tracking tool
Confluence:- Knowledge sharing protal where we can persist our project archetecture, technologies are being used and many other information related to project
Sharepoint:- Its a product of microsoft where it provides the platform to work together and provides standered business process for information sharing, document publishing etc
			(ie-> given a excel sheet with a numbers of test scenarios  where multiple people are working on the same sheet
			each and every individual has to know which one is tested so that there wont be any duplicate work for that reason the same excel should be 
			accessed to all the particepents and there we used microsoft sharepoint)

challenges you faced:- 
first:- Sometimes the testing requirements for a goven user story/user storys working functionality was not clear for us, 
Then we had to approach developer/Product manager to get the better understading, and somtimes its become challenging to put everyting in a single story, 
for those types complex stories sometimes i used to feel challenging.
Second:- we always had to ask for test data, to test certain scenarios we need certain test data which should match certain crateria
and sometimes we used face unavilablity of those kind of test data or used to take time to create those.
